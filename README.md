## Orbit2

This is a multi planet version of the [Orbit1](https://github.com/AlexErdei73/Orbit1) project. The Orbit2 class is the
extended version of the Plot class, which we use to make graphs. The simulation runs in its thread. We also add GUI 
controls to control the simulation by the user. More information can be found on the page 73 of 
[Physics Simulations Manual](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/javamanual.pdf).
